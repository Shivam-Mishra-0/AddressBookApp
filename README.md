# 📒 AddressBookApp

> A Spring Boot based Java application developed using Test-Driven Development (TDD) to progressively design and implement a digital Address Book system. The project emphasizes incremental development, layered architecture, and progressive feature expansion to build a scalable and maintainable contact management system.

### 📖 Overview

- Modular Spring Boot project focused on modelling and managing Address Book contacts with structured storage and retrieval capabilities.
- Organized around incremental Use Cases evolving from basic contact creation to advanced features such as search, sorting, persistence, and database integration.
- Emphasizes clean architecture using Controller–Service–Repository layers along with progressive feature additions.
- Focuses on maintainability, testability, and scalable project structure as the application grows.

### ✅ Implemented Features

> _Features will be added here as Use Cases are implemented._

- 🧩 **UC1 – Create Contact :**
  - Introduces the core **Contact domain model** representing an individual entry in the Address Book.
  - Defines essential contact attributes including **first name, last name, address, city, state, zip, phone number, and email**.
  - Establishes the foundational data structure that all future Address Book operations will manipulate.

  **Purpose**
  - To define a structured representation of a contact within the Address Book system.
  - To provide the base entity required for adding, editing, searching, and persisting contact information in later use cases.

  **Implementation**
  - Implemented a `Contact` model class within the **model layer** of the application.
  - Encapsulates all contact fields with appropriate constructors and accessor methods.
  - Added **unit tests (`ContactTest`)** to validate object creation and ensure correctness of stored contact attributes.
  - Establishes the foundational domain object used by future **service, repository, and controller layers**.

---

- 🧩 **UC2 – Add Contact to Address Book :**
  - Introduces the ability to add contacts to an Address Book using a REST API.
  - Establishes the basic service architecture required to manage contacts within multiple Address Books.

  **Purpose**
  - Enable the system to store contacts inside an Address Book.
  - Provide a backend API to add contact details such as first name, last name, address, city, state, zip, phone number, and email.

  **Implementation**
  - Implemented an `AddressBook` model that maintains a `List<Contact>` representing stored contacts.
  - Created `AddressBookService` to manage Address Books using a `Map<String, AddressBook>`.
  - Automatically creates an Address Book if it does not already exist.
  - Implemented `AddressBookController` exposing the REST endpoint:
    ```
    POST /addressbooks/{name}/contacts
    ```
  - Added unit tests (`AddressBookServiceTest`) covering contact addition, automatic Address Book creation, and handling multiple contacts.
---

- 🧩 **UC3 – Edit Existing Contact :**
  - Introduces the ability to update an existing contact in an Address Book through a REST API.
  - Enables modification of stored contact details while preserving the contact identity within the Address Book.

  **Purpose**
  - Allow users to update contact information such as address, city, state, zip, phone number, and email.
  - Provide a mechanism to locate a contact using first name and last name within a specific Address Book.

  **Implementation**
  - Added an `updateContact()` method in `AddressBookService` to locate a contact by `firstName` and `lastName` and update the contact details.
  - Implemented a REST endpoint in `AddressBookController`:
    ```
    PUT /addressbooks/{bookName}/contacts
    ```
  - The endpoint accepts `firstName` and `lastName` as query parameters and updated contact data in the request body.
  - Added unit tests to verify successful contact updates and handling of non-existing contacts or missing Address Books.

---

- 🧩 **UC4 – Delete Contact :**
  - Introduces the ability to remove an existing contact from an Address Book using a REST API.
  - Enables management of stored contacts by allowing deletion based on contact identity.

  **Purpose**
  - Allow users to delete a contact from an Address Book using the person's first name and last name.
  - Maintain accurate and up-to-date contact records within the system.

  **Implementation**
  - Implemented a `deleteContact()` method in `AddressBookService` to locate and remove a contact from the `List<Contact>` using `removeIf()`.
  - Added a REST endpoint in `AddressBookController`:
    ```
    DELETE /addressbooks/{bookName}/contacts
    ```
  - The endpoint accepts `firstName` and `lastName` as query parameters to identify the contact to be deleted.
  - Added unit tests verifying successful deletion, handling of non-existing contacts, and cases where the Address Book is not found.

### ⚙️ Development Approach

> This project follows an incremental **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** workflow:

- Tests are written first to define expected behaviour.
- Implementation code is developed to satisfy the tests.
- Each Use Case introduces new functionality in controlled steps.
- Existing behaviour is preserved through continuous refactoring.
- The system evolves through layered architecture using Controller, Service, and Repository separation.
- Progressive enhancements introduce search, sorting, persistence, multithreading, and database support.
